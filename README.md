# DKT-on-Extreme-Skills
Deep Knowledge Tracing on knowledge very difficult and easy to master

## Abstract
Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT),  along with other machine learning approaches, is biased toward  data  they  have  seen during training. Thus for problems where we have few amount of data for a certain class, the models will tend to give good results on classes where there are many examples and  less good results on those classes with few examples.  This problem occur generally when the classes to predict are imbalanced and this is frequent in educational data where for  example,  there  are  skills  that  are very difficult  or very easy to  master (we call them extreme skills). There  will  be less data regarding students that correctly answered questions related to difficult knowledge and that incorrectly answered knowledge easy to master.  In that case, DKT is unable to correctly predict the knowledge of a student on extreme skills.  In order to improve DKT in that sense, we borrowed a solution from imbalanced problems which is the penalization of the model.  In other words, we have augmented the loss function with the same loss where we have masked non-extreme skills.  We also included in the DKT, a bayesian network (built from domain experts) by using the attention mechanism. The resulting model is able to accurately track knowledge of students in Logic-Muse Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS), compare to the BKT or the original DKT.
